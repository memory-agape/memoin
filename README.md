    'API_KEY'   => 'API Key',
    'API_SECRET' => 'API Secret',
])))->getExchanger();

// send with GET method
$exchanger->get($apiUriHere);

// send with POST method
$exchanger->post($apiUriHere, $extendHeadersHere, $bodyHere);

// call by any method for RESTful APIs (PUT, DELETE and so on)
$exchanger->call($apiURIHere, $methodHere, $authHere, $extendHeadersHere, $bodyHere);

// streaming service
$exchanger->streaming(new class extends Memoin\API\Streaming {
  
      public function receive ($message) {
  
          // received streaming message
          print_r($message);
      }
